- webkit proxy system properties hackable?
- good job on biometrics (check on some of the issues I had previously)
- basic package integrity checks to avoid root (still valid in open-source?)
  or should move to play integrity api
- big git commit changes need pr and to be broken down
- refactor this project into jetpack compose
- too much scattered logic in classes, put into cohesive components
  for example: last pager index, and ui button index are confusing
- long press to add optional files is not obvious to user and violates UX rules
